    Possible stunts (not limited to these):
    Upgrade a boost to an aspect (with free invoke) replacing a boost, optionally, when you succeed with style for a specific action (Attack, Create an Advantage)
    Add a +2 opposition to a specific thing (ex. block moving; writing in code) when doing a specific action (ex. Overcome, Create an Advantage, Attack, Defend)
    Switch one specific skill with another specific skill when attempting something that's your speciality (ex. expert on Languages)
    Create an Advantage (no free invoke) that takes a Fair +2 roll to remove once per scene
    Ignore a simple rule (ex. can't use a skill twice in a challenge) once per scene
    Add a +3 opposition to a specific thing (ex. block moving; writing in code) when attempting something that's your speciality (ex. expert on Languages), once per scene
    Grant +2 to a specific action using a specific skill in a specific circumstance (ex. when you're On Fire; when you're Surrounded)
